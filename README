Refuge is a game developed for Ludum Dare 15. The theme for the compo was "caverns."

Since the competition, I've been adding some slight visual improvements, bug fixes,
and other things like leaderboards. The original game was built in 48-hours using
flixel (http://flixel.org) and sfxr.

You can play it online here:

NOTE:
To build this code, you will have to copy Config.as.template to Config.as and add
your own Mochi game ID and leaderboard ID. If you don't want to do that, you can
just comment out the imports and references to com.noonat.Mochi.
