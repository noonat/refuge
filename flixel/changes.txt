v1.25
===================================================================
Many thanks to flixel community member Nitram_Cero for the many
suggestions, and to indie dev Farbs for helping me take out the
"stupid giant invisible textbox" thing :)

> Buttons no longer briefly appear anchored in the upper left corner
> Fixed FlxTilemap collisions with non-0,0 position
> Fixed FlxTilemap rendering issue with unbounded camera
> FlxCore moved out of data to main folder
> Stupid giant invisible textbox no longer required for focus control
> Moved collide() into FlxCore
> Moved collideArray/s() and overlapArray/s() into FlxG
> collideArray/s() and overlapArray/s() self-check now
> Added onEmit() function to FlxSprite
> Optimized FlxSprite rendering a bit
> Fixed bug in per-pixel overlapPoint()
> Added alpha to FlxSprite (without falling back on vector renderer!)
> Added scaling to FlxSprite (display only, bounding box must be scaled manually)
> Fullscreen mode (BETA): Esc to toggle, TAB for Button A, SPACE for Button B
> NOTE: Fullscreen mode requires special "allowFullScreen" HTML property
> FlxSprite's facing variable uses getters, setters and consts now!



v1.21
===================================================================
Thanks to SeiferTim from the flixel community for spotting the
tilemap bug, and reminding me to put in the other function too!

> Fixed tilemap display bug on certain non-square levels
> Added "specificFrame" function to FlxSprite (like randomFrame)

NOTE: FlxSprite.specificFrame is NOT documented in nanodoc!



v1.2
===================================================================
Big thanks to the flixel community for helping to
debug v1.1 and for helping to design v1.2!

> Fixed bug with facing & proc-gen box sprites
> Added FlxGame constructor param for skipping Flixel logo
> Removed the deletes in FlxArray's "remove" functions
> Simplified FlxArray "clear" function
> Added null checks to overlap and collide functions
> Fade and Flash need param Force == true to reset themselves
> Flash has a callback now
> FlxButtons use scrollFactor, visible, and flicker properly now
> General corrections to the way overlap works with scrollfactor
> Fixed pause music looping bug
> FlxG.scores and FlxG.levels are flxarrays now
> Doublechecked manual scroll manipulation
> Added new class FlxLayer
> FlxEmitter has optional parameter for parent FlxLayer
> FlxEmitter will not auto-add pre-existing sprites
> added new class FlxTilemap
> added callback to FlxSprite animation system
> fixed excessive frame calculation in FlxSprite animation
> added new optional PlayStateTiles to Mode example code



v1.1
===================================================================
First thanks to John Nesky, Ivan Safrin, radix, owen
and the rest of the flixel community for
helping to track this stuff down. 

> Nasty manually-reversed animations bug fixed
> Nasty music bug fixed
> mouse cursor works properly with scrolling screens now
> FlxEmitter can now shoot out more than one particle per frame
> Fixed scrollFactor documentation
> Documented animation FrameRate parameter
> add keyword internal to a bunch of stuff in FlxG
> add a force variable to FlxSprite.play()
> SingleFrame parameter for animations removed, just use []
> change name of 'alive' to 'active' (thanks radmoseph!)
